Instructions:

Use the provided credentials to access AWS cloud trail logs and answer the questions.
 

Scenario
Welcome, Defender! As an incident responder, we're granting you access to the AWS account called "Security" as an IAM user. This account contains a copy of the logs during the time period of the incident and has the ability to assume the "Security" role in the target account so you can look around to spot the misconfigurations that allowed for this attack to happen.


Credentials
Your IAM credentials for the Security account:

Login: https://flaws2-security.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
Account ID: 322079859186
Username: security
Password: password
Access Key: AKIAIUFNQ2WCOPTEITJQ
Secret Key: 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
 
Environment
The credentials above give you access to the Security account, which can assume the role of "security" in the Target account. You also have access to an S3 bucket, named flaws2_logs, in the Security account, that contains the CloudTrail logs recorded during a successful compromise.
